&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Food Drop** is an iOS application for mobile devices, that was born with a mission to combat the issue 
of food waste in America.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The high level concept of our app allows restaurants to make food listings of leftover meals 
that werenâ€™t sold throughout the day or quality food restaurants just want to get rid of at the end of
the day, to free up their kitchen inventory. These meals can then be claimed by an organization or individual,
for pick up at a discounted price or for free. Thereby starting a movement, contributing to the effort of
minimizing food waste nationwide by starting with helping local people, businesses and communities.
